<h2 class="text-danger fw-bold mb-4">Children Dedication</h2>
  <p class="fs-5">
    Children’s Dedication at EMAW Church is a ceremony where parents commit to raising their child in the knowledge and love of the Lord, and the church pledges support through prayer and discipleship (similar to Hannah’s dedication of Samuel). It is not baptism for infants but a promise by parents—and affirmation by the congregation—that the child will be nurtured in faith. During the service, parents present the child before the congregation; the pastor prays for wisdom, protection, and spiritual growth. The church family stands alongside, committing to encourage and model Christlike living for the child until they can personally decide to follow Jesus.
