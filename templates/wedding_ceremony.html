<h2 class="text-danger fw-bold mb-4">Wedding Ceremonies</h2>
  <p class="fs-5">
    Weddings at EMAW Church celebrate the sacred covenant between a man and a woman, reflecting Christ’s relationship with the Church (Ephesians 5:25–27). Our Wedding Ministry offers premarital counseling to help couples build a Christ-centered foundation: communication, conflict resolution, spiritual disciplines together, and understanding biblical marriage roles. The ceremony is held in the church sanctuary (or approved venue), led by a pastor who prays over the couple, reads Scripture, and leads vows. Family and friends witness and bless the union. After the ceremony, we encourage ongoing support through marriage enrichment classes, small groups, and pastoral care to nurture a lifelong, God-honoring marriage.
