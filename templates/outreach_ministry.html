    Missions

    Evangelism (Door-to-Door)

    Our Door-to-Door Evangelism team boldly takes the message of salvation directly to homes in our neighborhoods. We share the Good News face-to-face, pray for households, and invite them to experience the love of Christ within our community.

    Crusades

    We organize powerful evangelistic crusades that gather people from all walks of life to hear the life-changing message of Jesus Christ. These open-air events are filled with praise, preaching, and miracles, drawing many to the Kingdom of God.

    Jesus Filming (Cinema)
  </p>
  <p class="fs-5">
    Through Jesus Film outreaches, we present the Gospel in a compelling and visual format using cinema. This method is especially effective in communities with limited access to traditional preaching, drawing many to Christ through storytelling.
