    Prayer and Fasting

    Prayer Summits
  </p>
  <p class="fs-5">
    We host powerful prayer summits that gather believers to intercede for the nation, the church, and individual needs. These summits are filled with prophetic declarations and divine encounters.

    Prayer Retreats
  </p>
  <p class="fs-5">
    Prayer retreats offer a quiet, focused environment where intercessors spend extended time in the presence of God. It’s a time for deep reflection, revelation, and spiritual empowerment.
