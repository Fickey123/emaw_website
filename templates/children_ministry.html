    GOSHEN CHILDREN BIBLE CLUB
  </p>
  <p class="fs-5">
    Our hearts were deeply moved when we saw the lives of children in the Kibera slums which is in Nairobi, Kenya. 
  </p>
  <p class="fs-5">
    We saw children growing up in difficult conditions, surrounded by poverty, struggle, and uncertainty. Many of them face daily hunger, neglect, and lack of guidance at a very young age which leads most of them to become hopeless street children. 
  </p>
  <p class="fs-5">
    We were touched by the pain of seeing children with no safe place to live, no one to listen to them, and little hope for their future. Yet, even in these hardships, we saw bright smiles and a deep need for love, care, and direction. 
  </p>
  <p class="fs-5">
    We felt a strong calling to share God’s love with these children—to let them know that they are precious, valued, and never forgotten by God. We desired to plant seeds of faith, hope, and good character in their hearts while they are still young. 
  </p>
  <p class="fs-5">
    Goshen Bible club was born out of compassion, prayer, and a desire to be a light in their lives. We decided to walk with these children, encourage them, and help them grow with hope, joy, and faith in God despite their circumstances. 
  </p>

    Seeing the hunger of the vulnerable children in the slums we began a feeding program for these children which is done every Saturday morning hours.Seeing the hunger of the vulnerable children in the slums we began a feeding program for these children which is done every Saturday morning hours.

              We began Goshen Academy & pre-school because we could no longer ignore the quiet suffering of Vulnerable children in the slums—children full of potential, yet denied the simple gift of education. Many woke each day to hardship instead of hope, carrying responsibilities far too heavy for their young hearts.

              Goshen pre-school was born out of love and compassion. It is a safe place where Vulnerable children are welcomed, cared for, and reminded that they matter. Through learning, encouragement, and care, we help them rediscover their worth and believe in a future beyond poverty. We believe every child deserves a chance to dream, to learn, and to rise, no matter where they come from.
